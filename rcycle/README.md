# task3-rcycle-rcycle
Write, from scratch, two functions in Racket. The ﬁrst is called lcycle. It takes a list as input and returns the list cyclically shifted one place to the left. The second is called rcycle, and it shifts the list cyclically shifted one place to the right.

For example: 
```Racket 
> (lcycle (list 1 2 3 4 5))
'(2 3 4 5 1) 

> (rcycle (list 1 2 3 4 5))
'(5 1 2 3 4)
```
